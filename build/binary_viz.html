<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>For small data sets and/or static applications, Matplotlib and similar tools work well. For larger data sets, more powerful tools are needed. For real-time inspection of 3-d data, one absolutely needs a visualization tool. In this lesson, we look at Visit, which is a highly-scalable viz tool born out of the ASCI program (which was the computational solution to the end of underground weapons testing).</p>

      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will load and view data in Visit.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
