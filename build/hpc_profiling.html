<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>The basic timing we did last time is a good tool to have, but sometimes it’s better to profile your code a bit more comprehensively. Here, we’ll look at how to use tools like <code>gprof</code> to figure out where execution bottlenecks may be hurting your program’s performance.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will be able to choose the proper tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<ul>
<li>How fast can I actually go, and which things are stopping me?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gprof">gprof</a> tool is readily accessible and gives substantial information about run-time performance of programs. Googles <a href="https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/cpuprofile.html">gperftools</a> is another great tool.</p>
<p>There are numerous other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_performance_analysis_tools">performance tools</a> available. <a href="">Valgrind</a> includes <code>cachegrind</code> and <code>callgrind</code> that are useful tools for understanding execution in more detail.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will use <code>gprof</code> and <code>gperftools</code> to profile a C++ program.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
