<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>String data is all around us, but the data of interest is often embedded within complex structures that may be somewhat arbitrary in format (e.g., the speech-to-text of a political debate) or structured but complicated (e.g., the output of some simulation software). Regex is a way to define patterns that can be matched to string data.</p>

      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will inspect an existing HDF5 file using <code>h5py</code>.</li>
<li>Students will create their own HDF5 file using <code>h5py</code>.</li>

********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
