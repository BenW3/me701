<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>Although binary-formatted data is best in many applications for improved efficiency, we lose the human-readable simplicity of text-based formats. One solution is to adopt binary formats with well defined interfaces for getting and setting data from and to binary format. Many formats are available and tend to be domain specific. Here, we survey two formats widely used in technical computing applications: <a href="">HDF5</a> and <a href="">VTK</a>.</p>

-->
<ul>
<li>Students will inspect an existing HDF5 file using <code>h5py</code>.</li>
<li>Students will create their own HDF5 file using <code>h5py</code>.</li>
<li>Students will create a VTK file with scalar and vector data for visualization in Paraview or Visit.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
