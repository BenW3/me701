<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>We’ll continue with our survey of <code>git</code> and GitHub with a focus now on navigating local and remote branches. As we get further into collaborative work (including with ourselves!), <em>merge conflicts</em> will arise, and we’ll see how to handle them.</p>

-->
<ul>
<li>Students will clone a remote repository, make a new branch, and push changes in that branch to the remote</li>
<li>Students will explain how to fix a merge conflict.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
