<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>In this lesson, we explore again the C++ standard library (and STL) for use with our classes. In particular, we explore smart pointers and containers for collecting multiple objects of a user-defined class hierarchy.</p>

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>Allen Downey, <em>Think C++</em> is available for free <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf">online</a> and is a nice, basic introduction to programming using C++ as the language.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com">C++ Reference website</a> includes a lot of documentation, including an <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr">overview</a> of the <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> class.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will describe what a “smart point” is and how it differs from a “dumb pointer.”</li>
<li>Students will predict and confirm how a reference-counted pointer manages the memory associated with an object throughout execution of a program.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
