<h1 id="pointers-arrays-and-memory-management">Pointers, Arrays, and Memory Management</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>In this lesson, we’ll review (or introduce?) the concept of a pointer and their connection to arrays. We’ll also see how to allocate memory dynamically, which requires we manage that memory. Valgrind is a tool we’ll find can help us identify when we’ve misbehaved!</p>

-->
<p>Allen Downey, <em>Think C++</em> is available for free <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf">online</a> and is a nice, basic introduction to programming using C++ as the language.</p>

********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will articulate the difference between “value”, “reference”, and “pointer.”</li>
<li>Students will articulate the difference between “pointer” and “array.”</li>
<li>Students will articulate the difference between “stack” and “heap.”</li>
<li>Students will write a program that employs array processing.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
