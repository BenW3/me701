<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll dive into the command line and get to know some basic commands.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>An exhaustive resource is <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a>, from which readings will be indicated for several lessons. The book is quite long, and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware of commands in the first place). Then, students can dive in to material that is either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands like <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
