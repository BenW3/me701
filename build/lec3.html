Short description of the lesson.

<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>An exhaustive resource is <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a>, from which readings will be indicated for several lessons. The book is quite long, and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware of commands in the first place). Then, students can dive in to material that is either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands like <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
