<h1 id="survey-of-numpy">Survey of NumPy</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>NumPy (short for numerical Python) is the core component for just about all technical computing done with Python. In this lesson, we examine its basic components with a focus on arrays and linear systems.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>The <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> project provides a lot of documentation and support, including <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html">this introductory tutorial</a>.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will install (if needed) and import NumPy.</li>
<li>Students will construct NumPy arrays to represent vector quantities.</li>
<li>Students will construct NumPy arrays to represent matrix quantities.</li>
<li>Students will use NumPy to solve linear systems of the form <img

title="\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}" 
src="/equation_images/%255Cmathbf%257BAx%257D%253D%255Cmathbf%257Bb%257D" 
alt="LaTeX: \mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}" 
data-equation-content="\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}" 
/>.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>

********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
