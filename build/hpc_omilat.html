<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>Only masochists implement linear algebra themselves. We’ll see why that is by comparing the best code we can write in C++ to the off-the-shelf tools from the professionals.</p>

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will be able to choose the proper tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<ul>
<li>How fast can I actually go?</li>
<li>Is a library a better option?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAS">BLAS</a> specification defines a variety of low-level, vector-vector, matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix subroutines essential to many numerical computing applications.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPACK</a> specification builds on BLAS to define solvers for linear and eigen systems, various decompositions, etc.</p>
<p>Intel’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library">Math Kernel Library (MKL)</a> is among the best performing implementations of BLAS/LAPACK, especially on Intel systems.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software">ATLAS</a> library is a BLAS/LAPACK implementation that uses parameterized code and numerical experiments to “tune” the final compiled code to one’s machine. A similar approach was used to produce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFTW">FFTW</a> library that implements fast Fourier transforms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigen_(C%2B%2B_library)">Eigen</a> is a template (head-only) C++ library that implements BLAS and some of LAPACK. Because it uses only headers, it is very easy to incorporate into existing code.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a> benchmark is a widely used for testing the performance of large-scale compute clusters. However, it’s good for single-cove studies, too. We’ll use the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/mkl-windows-developer-guide/top/intel-math-kernel-library-benchmarks/intel-distribution-for-linpack-benchmark/overview-of-the-intel-distribution-for-linpack-benchmark.html">Intel implementation</a>.</p>

********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will run several versions of a BLAS-driven program.</li>
<li>Students will run the LINPACK and/or similar performance benchmarks.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
