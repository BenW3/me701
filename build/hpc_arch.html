<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>Here, we try to answer “what is a computer?” a bit more carefully than we might have understood it to be. The modern cache-based computer is a complicated beast, with a variety of special-purpose registers that can greatly accelerate how much “work” we can do. We’ll start with the basic unit of work, the floating-point operation, and then try to understand what our machines should, in theory, be capable of doing. We’ll then show that may not be the case…ever.</p>

<ul>
<li>Students will be able to choose the proper tool.</li>
<li>Students will be able to list the basic components of a modern computer.</li>
<li>Students will know how to perform basic timing of their programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<ul>
<li>How fast can I actually go?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>Hager and Wellein, Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Computational Science) is a great resource for performance-oriented, scientific programmers.</p>

-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will describe their CPUs and memory.</li>
<li>Students will using basic timing functions to estimate FLOPS for a simple program.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
