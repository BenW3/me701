<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>PyQt5 supports many “bells and whistles.” Here, we limit our scope to one specific tool, namely Matplotlib and its PyQt5 backend.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<p>Students will be able to choose the appropriate software tool or technique for a given application.</p>
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<ul>
<li>When are GUIs the right answer?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p><a href="http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5">This website</a> has lots of wonderful example code that is about as good as anything I’ve seen out there.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/">PyQt5</a> for all GUIs.</p>
<p>PyQt5 builds on Qt5, for which all the documentation is available <a href="http://www.qt.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>An old but conceptually relevant textbook is Summerfield, <em>Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt</em>, Prentice Hall (2007).<br />
However, this is swiftly becoming dated since Qt has moved on to version 5, and many things are not backwards compatible.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pyqt5">so many</a> PyQt5 videos out there!</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will load PyQt5 and execute example code.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
