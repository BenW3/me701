Although the page produced from this is learner-facing, some of the
lesson plan structure
-->
<h1 id="basic-shell-scripting">Basic Shell Scripting</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>By the end of this lecture, you will understand how to write simple programs in <code>bash</code>, the The Bourne again shell we are using in Linux.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>An exhaustive resource is <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a>, from which readings will be indicated for several lessons. The book is quite long, and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware of commands in the first place). Then, students can dive in to material that is either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets/blob/master/languages/bash.sh">bash cheat sheet</a> is quite extensive.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will define and use variables in <code>bash</code></li>
<li>Students will explain what special variables like <code>$1</code> mean in <code>bash</code></li>
<li>Students will write short functions in <code>bash</code> that perform simple tasks</li>
<li>Students will execute all examples provided in the lesson notebook</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

<h3 id="required-preparation">Required Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Skim TLC 363–494</li>
<li>Create a comparison sheet of bash relative to your favorite programming language. Most likely, <code>bash</code> (as a language) is new to all of you, and I find the best way to learn a new language is to compare its syntax (variables, if statements, for loops, etc.) to those of a language I already know (e.g., Python). You may find <a href="https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets/blob/master/languages/bash.sh">this cheat sheet</a> to be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="live-activities">Live Activities</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Brief discussion of <code>bash</code> and its origins</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to define variables in <code>bash</code></li>
<li>Demonstrate and reinforce some command line tricks like “piping” with <code>|</code></li>
<li>Demonstrate how to construct functions in <code>bash</code></li>
<li>Demonstrate basic <code>if</code> statements and loops.</li>
</ol>

<li><a href="https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/71e3cbcaaadf46df8134e058a538b5821d">Lecture, Fall 2019</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2020/lectures/BashDemo.ipynb">slides</a>. If you want to execute the notebook, you will need to install the <code>bash</code> kernel for Jupyter. That is not necessary; all commands I use can be executed directly in the terminal or saved and run as scripts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="useful-tips-to-be-updated-as-we-learn">Useful Tips (To Be Updated As We Learn!)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Variable assignments should not have spaces (i.e., <code>a=123</code> is good but <code>a = 123</code> is bad).</li>
</ul>
