<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>In this lesson, we learn how to define <em>classes</em> that include a public <em>interface</em> and private <em>attributes</em>. The public interface<br />
include methods for <em>construction</em> and <em>destruction</em> of an object and any methods needed to access or modify data an object encapsulates. Usually, this data is encapsulated, i.e., it is not available to the user of the object.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will be able to select the right tool for the application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="essential-questions">Essential Questions</h2>
<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->
<ul>
<li>How to we make and use an object?<br />
</li>
<li>What is an <em>initialization list</em>?</li>
<li>Can we have <code>const</code> member variables?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->
<p>Allen Downey, <em>Think C++</em> is available for free <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf">online</a> and is a nice, basic introduction to programming using C++ as the language.</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup, <em>A Tour of C++</em>, 2nd Ed., is a survey of C++ written by the inventor of C++. It’s a nice and short book that discusses the essential syntax of modern C++.</p>
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess students’ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will define and use a class in a C++ program.</li>
<li>Students will understand how various constructors are defined and used.</li>
<li>Students will understand how a destructor is used.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

<h3 id="required-preparation">Required Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapters 8, 9 and 14 of <a href="">Think C++</a>. Note, 8 and 9 deal with C++ <code>struct</code>, which is equivalent to a class with one small difference (members are by default <code>public</code>, not <code>private</code>).</li>
<li>Review how classes and objects work in Python.</li>
<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/me701/cpp_classes">this repository</a>.</li>

<h3 id="live-activities">Live Activities</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Present basic structure of a C++ class and compare, as needed, to Python.</li>
<li>Walk through the <code>Point</code> class and supporting code.<br />
</li>
<li>Extend the <code>Point</code> class and application program.</li>
<li>Define a <code>Vector</code> class similar to NumPy arrays. Watch the memory!</li>
