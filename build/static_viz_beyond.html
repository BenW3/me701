Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>This lesson is a stub for future use. I’m actually happy with the material covered so far. Other plotting software exists, e.g., <code>plot.ly</code> and <code>ggplot</code>, and <code>bokeh</code>, all available from Python and other languages. No video is made, but I have a notebook with examples linked below.</p>
