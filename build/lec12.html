<h1 id="modules-and-unit-tests">Modules and Unit Tests</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->
<p>Organizing Python code in files leads to importable <em>modules</em> that help us to glue together more complex programs. With test-driven development and unit tests, these modules can be produced with fewer bugs and improved functionality.</p>

<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->
<ul>
<li>Students will clone a sample repository with a predefined module.</li>
<li>Students will write unit tests.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
