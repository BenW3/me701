<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we continue navigating the command line. Along the way, we will learn about and then define environment variables.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>An exhaustive resource is <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a>, from which readings will be indicated for several lessons. The book is quite long, and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware of commands in the first place). Then, students can dive in to material that is either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.</p>
