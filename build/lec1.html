<p>In this lesson, the course administrivia is summarized. A broad overview of the course intention and content is provided. Finally, students are directed to the appropriate installation of a Linux or Linux-like environment needed for learning the shell. This environment will also be used optionally later on for C++ development.</p>

<h3 id="required-preparation">Required Preparation</h3>
<p>Students should read the class Syllabus.</p>
<p>Students should come to class with a suitable laptop computer or make sure to follow the recorded lesson to repeat the process at home.</p>
<p>Students should ensure they have access to the websites listed above under resources.</p>
<h3 id="live-activities">Live Activities</h3>
<p>(Note, some of these may be repeated in older videos, but I intend to use my live time with your to go through most of the steps. Sometimes, we’ll have to explore truncated versions of planned activities.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction to Linux (brief; video provides more detail)</li>
<li>Navigate to instructions for the majority. This is likely WSL.</li>
<li>Work through the instructions linked to above with the students.<br />
Debug situations as is necessary. Remember to <em>enable</em> WSL first, which requires the restart.</li>
<li>Open the Ubuntu terminal. Update as needed or recommended.</li>
<li>Restart, etc., as needed.</li>
<li>Demonstrate a few applications that preview the <code>bash</code> introduction.</li>
<li>Install the <code>X</code> server to enable graphical windows (e.g., <code>gedit</code>).</li>
<li>Install <code>gedit</code>.</li>
<li>Debrief with students about remaining issues.</li>
</ol>

Note, this video has lots of “empty” space since we’re all installing Linux in a more time consuming manner than WSL. However, you can use this as a guide for a VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu or Linux Mint on either Windows or OS X.</li>
