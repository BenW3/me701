<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this lesson, the course administrivia is summarized. A broad overview of the course intention and content is provided. Finally, students are directed to the appropriate installation of a Linux or Linux-like environment needed for learning the shell. This environment will be our primary one for all development.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will report their hardware and operating system.</li>
<li>Students will install the appropriate version of Linux.</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate their Linux installation works by performing a simple test.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log and by revisiting the use of Linux in future tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<p>(This is what you do before, during, and after a lecture.)</p>
<h3 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Students should read the class Syllabus.</li>
<li>Students should come to class with a suitable laptop computer or make sure to follow the recorded lesson to repeat the process at home.</li>
<li>Students should ensure they have access to the websites listed above under resources.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="during-lecture">During Lecture</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Course information and introductions.</li>
<li>Navigate to instructions for installing WSL. If you do not have Windows 10, tell me!</li>
<li>Work through the instructions linked to above.<br />
Debug situations as is necessary. Remember to <em>enable</em> WSL first, which requires the restart. You will need to define a username and password for WSL. I recommend your Windows name and password; if you forget it later, you’ll have to reinstall!</li>
<li>Open the Ubuntu terminal. Update as needed or recommended.</li>
<li>Restart, etc., as needed.</li>
<li>Demonstrate a few applications that preview the <code>bash</code> introduction.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">X Server for WSL</a></li>
<li>Install <code>xclock</code> via <code>apt-get install x11-apps</code> and execute.</li>
<li>Debrief with students about remaining issues.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>WSL is under active development, so don’t be discouraged if you have issues!</em></p>
<h3 id="after-lecture">After Lecture</h3>
<p>If you miss lecture or need to review the material, you’ll find the link to the lecture here. When relevant, older videos will be linked.</p>
<p><a href="https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/2403e03a8ff3438ba1dfd2e848d4231d1d">Video, Lecture, 08/23/2021</a></p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to fill out your learning log!</p>
<h3 id="jeremys-notes">Jeremy’s Notes</h3>
<p>I’ll try to jot down my thoughts about the lesson, similar to your own logs (though less formal and less personal).)</p>
<ul>
<li>Account for Windows update times</li>
<li>Bring “red” / “green” indicators</li>
<li>Steps 7, 8, and 9 will be done next time (or a quick video will be made).</li>
<li>Anything Mac users could do while waiting?…</li>
<li>GUIs sound like a hit</li>
</ul>

   and [slides](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2019/lectures/GettingSetUp.ipynb). Note, this video has lots of "empty" space since we're
   all installing Linux in a more time consuming manner than WSL.  However, you can use this as a guide for a VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu or Linux Mint on either Windows or OS X.
