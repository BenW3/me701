# Collaborative Version Control with `git` and GitHub                                                         

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to demonstrate the
basic, collaborative development cycle using `git` and GitHub (or
similar repository-hosting systems).  Along the way, you will work
with a partner to complete part of the next homework.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

  - Students will be able to employ command-line tools to create, access, and
    modify remote software repositories.

  - Students will be able to write succinct messages for the repository
    log that describe source-code modifications.

  - Students will be able to select an appropriate collaborative workflow.


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

  - How can I use a `git` repository that lives on another server?

  - How can my friend and I work on the same repository at the same time?

  - What is a `branch` and a `fork`?

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book is freely available and
provides just about all one needs to dive into `git` for the first time.

Atlassian provides this [nice git cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will clone, modify, and push changes to a remote repository.
  - Students will fork, clone, modify, push changes to and create a pull
    request for a remote repository.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
