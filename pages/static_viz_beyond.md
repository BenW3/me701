# Static Viz beyond Matplotlib

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

This lesson is a stub for future use.  I'm actually happy with the material 
covered so far.  Other plotting software exists, e.g., `plot.ly` and
`ggplot`, and `bokeh`, all available from Python and other languages.
No video is made, but I have a notebook with examples linked below.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

 - Students will be able to choose the proper tool.
 - Students will be able to show data graphically in static 
   and dynamic form.


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

 - TBD

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

A [good list](https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries/) of tools (a bit outdated but still relevant):

 
<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will report their learning in their logs.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
-->

### Required Preparation

 - TBD


### Live Activities

  1. Quick look at Plot.ly and Bokeh (skip TikZ)

### Materials

- [Beyond Matplotlib](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2020/lectures/BeyondMatplotlib.ipynb) and [video](https://youtu.be/s4u7LY-214E).
