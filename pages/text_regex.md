# Test Processing with Python and Regex

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

String data is all around us, but the data of interest is often
embedded within complex structures that may be somewhat arbitrary in format (e.g.,
the speech-to-text of a political debate) or structured but complicated
(e.g., the output of some simulation software).  Regex is a way to
define patterns  that can be matched to string data.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

 - Students will be able to choose the proper tool.
 - Students will be able to find, load, manipulate, and save
   data.


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

 - How can I search for complicated expressions in text data?

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->


The Python documentation on its [Regex module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will inspect an existing HDF5 file using `h5py`.
  - Students will create their own HDF5 file using `h5py`.
  - Students will create a VTK file with scalar and
    vector data for visualization in Paraview or Visit.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
