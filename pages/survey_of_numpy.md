# Survey of NumPy                                                                

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

NumPy (short for numerical Python) is the core component for just about
all technical computing done with Python.  In this lesson, we examine
its basic components with a focus on arrays and linear systems.  

<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

The [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) project provides a lot of documentation and
support, including [this introductory tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will install (if needed) and import NumPy.
  - Students will construct NumPy arrays to represent vector quantities.
  - Students will construct NumPy arrays to represent matrix quantities.
  - Students will use NumPy to solve linear systems of the form $\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}$.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - Review [linear systems](http://robertsj.github.io/python_for_engineers/courses/pythonic_apps_2/modules/module_2/module_2.html).
  - Review [least squares](http://robertsj.github.io/python_for_engineers/courses/pythonic_apps_2/modules/module_3/least_squares.html)


### Live Activities

  1. Set up a linear system using NumPy arrays for a small heat-conduction problem.
  2. Discuss the challenges of systems when they are not square.

   (Note, some of this will feel a bit advanced.  Don't worry.  I just want you to be able to set up
   linear systems for your applications using NumPy.)
