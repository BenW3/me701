# Sources of Numerical Error                                                       

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

Computers most often work with data encoded in a binary (1's and 0's) format.
We humans tend to think in decimal.  To go between the two formats on a
machine with finite memory requires we make approximations all the time,
even if we don't notice.  We'll cover binary and decimal representation with
a focus on numerical applications.  However, the core ideas are
important to any low-level signal processing and data handling
that we do later on.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->




<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will be able to select and install an appropriate version of
    Python and related packages.
  - Students will write and execute a simple program in Python.
  - Students will use Python as a "graphing calculator"
    to compute and visualize results for simple problems.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - Review [finite differences](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Numerical_Differentiation.html) for context.
  - Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) on
    the IEEE_754 floating-point standard and tinker with
    [this neat tool](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html).



### Live Activities

  1. Define fixed-point and floating-point numbers.
  2. Convert between binary and decimal values.
