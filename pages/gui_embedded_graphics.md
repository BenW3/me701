# Embedding Graphics in PyQt5 Applications                                               

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

PyQt5 supports many "bells and whistles."  Here, we limit our scope to
one specific tool, namely Matplotlib and its PyQt5 backend.

<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

Students will be able to choose the appropriate software tool or
technique for a given application.



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

  - When are GUIs the right answer?

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

[This website](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5) has lots of wonderful
example code that is about as good as anything I've seen out there.

We use [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/) for
all GUIs.

PyQt5 builds on Qt5, for which all the documentation is
available [here](http://www.qt.io).

An old but conceptually relevant textbook is
Summerfield, *Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt*, Prentice Hall (2007).  
However, this is swiftly becoming dated since Qt has moved on to version 5,
and many things are not backwards compatible.

There are [so many](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pyqt5)
PyQt5 videos out there!

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will load PyQt5 and execute example code.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
-->

### Required Preparation

 - Go over this  [example](https://matplotlib.org/examples/user_interfaces/embedding_in_qt5.html) about connecting to the Matplotlib Qt5 backend.
 - Skim the [README](https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph) for PyQtGraph, a Qt-based module for faster-than-Matplotlib visualization.

### Live Activities

  1. Review layouts
  2. Examine the embedded plot example
