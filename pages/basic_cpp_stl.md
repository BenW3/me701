# C++ Standard Template Library                                             

## Summary


<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

In this lesson, we'll introduce template functions and classes and briefly look at the containers and algorithms supplied by C++ and its [standard template library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library).


<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

Allen Downey, *Think C++* is available for
free [online](http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf) and is a nice,
basic introduction to programming using C++ as the language.




<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will list several C++ template containers.
  - Students will describe what a template is.
  - Students will create explicit containers for a variety of
    intrinsic types.
  - Students will use containers and algorithms to manipulate data.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - Get this [repository](https://github.com/me701/cpp_stl_tutorial)
  - Skim these overviews of C++ [containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container) and [algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm).
  - Review Chapter 10 of [Downey](http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf) for an extensive overview of `std::vector<T>`
