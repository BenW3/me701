The recommended Python framework is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual),
which comes with everything we will need by default for this part of the
course.

A fairly representative set of topics is provided by my old
ME 400 notes [Python for Engineers](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html).
