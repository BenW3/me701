# Branches, Remotes, and Conflicts                                                        

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

We'll continue with our survey of `git` and GitHub with a focus
now on navigating local and remote branches.  As we get further into
collaborative work (including with ourselves!), *merge conflicts*
will arise, and we'll see how to handle them.



<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

  - Students will be able to create, update, and push branches.

  - Students will be able to define remote repository locations and
    fetch/push updates from/to those repositories.

  - Students will be able to recognize avoidable merge conflicts and
    resolve unavoidable merge conflicts


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

  - What happens if my friend and I both make a pull request into the
    same remote branch?

  - How can make a development branch on my computer and have it show up
    on GitHub?

  - What is the difference between `branch`, `clone`, and `fork`?

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book is freely available and
provides just about all one needs to dive into `git` for the first time.

Atlassian provides this [nice git cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will clone a remote repository, make a new branch, and push
    changes in that branch to the remote
  - Students will explain how to fix a merge conflict.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
-->

### Required Preparation

  - Skim Pro Git chapters 5 and 6.


### Live Activities

  1. Revisit https://github.com/me701/homework2_teams/
  2.

### Videos

 - [Lecture, Fall 2019](https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/0b11a97836724467afc6150837ce3e9f1d)
   and [slides](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2019/lectures/CollaborativeVersionControl.ipynb).


### Useful Tips (To Be Updated As We Learn!)

  - Don't forget that you need `git add` and `git commit` before
    `git push`
  - Students should review pull requests by others; maybe a formal
    assignment of who does what would be good
  -
