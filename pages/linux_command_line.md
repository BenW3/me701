# The Linux Command Line                                                                 

## Summary

In this lesson, we'll dive into the command line and get to know some basic commands.


## Resources

An exhaustive resource is [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php),
from which readings will be indicated for several lessons.  The book is quite long,
and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware
of commands in the first place).  Then, students can dive in to material that is
either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands like
    `pwd`, `cd`, `rm`, `mv`, etc.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture 

  - Bring a laptop with Linux ready for use.
  - Read Part 1 (pp. 1--124) of [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php). Note, the
    introduction is quite useful, too.
  - Start a "cheat sheet" of the commands that appear to be useful. You can fill
    in details on-the-fly via recorded or in-person instruction.


### During Lecture

  1. Open with discussion of terminals and emulators.
  2. Launch a Linux shell and explore a number of common commands.


### After Lecture

For a quick recap, I put together a short tutorial based on the linked website:
