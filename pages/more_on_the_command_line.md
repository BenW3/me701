# More On The Command Line                                                                 

## Summary

In this lesson, we continue navigating the command line.  Along the way, we
will learn about and then define environment variables.

## Resources

An exhaustive resource is [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php),
from which readings will be indicated for several lessons.  The book is quite long,
and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware
of commands in the first place).  Then, students can dive in to material that is
either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will be able to make directories, move files to their directories,
    and move directories.
  - Students will explain the basic rules for file naming in Linux.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture 

  - Bring a laptop with Linux ready for use.
  - Read Chapters 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18 of The Linux Command Line. (Some overlap with last time)
  - Continue your "cheat sheet" of the commands that appear to be useful.


### During Lecture 

  1. Live walk through of many commands.
  2. Creation of first `bash` script.
