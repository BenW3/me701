# The Structure of Python Programs                                                      

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

The basic structure of Python code is discussed using conditional
statements (i.e., `if`), loops, and functions to illustrate.

<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

[codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online resource that gamifies
the code-building experience.  The site emphasizes test-driven development.


<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will explain what a Python program does (or doesn't) do.
  - Students will produce code to solve simple problems.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - A laptop with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
  - Review lectures 13 and 14 of [Python for Engineers](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html).
  - Sign up for [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

### Live Activities

  1. Clone [repository](https://github.com/me701/python_example_programs)
     with sample programs that illustrate fundamental structures.
  2. Provide 2 to 3 in-class exercises to build on demonstration programs.
  3. Quick walk through of [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

### Videos

 - [Summary Slides](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2020/lectures/TheStructureOfPython.ipynb).

The following are my most recent ME 400 videos on the topics of `if` statements,
loops (`for` and `while`) and functions.  Of course, the total time is long, but
you can use these to fill in any gaps you think you may have.
