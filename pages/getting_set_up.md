# Getting Set Up                                                                     

## Summary

In this lesson, the course administrivia is summarized.  A broad overview
of the course intention and content is provided.  Finally, students are
directed to the appropriate installation of a Linux or Linux-like environment
needed for learning the shell.  This environment will be our primary one for
all development.


## Resources


  - [Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

  - [Installing X Server for WSL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)


Mostly for reference:

  - [Installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/)




##  Evidence of Student Learning


  - Students will report their hardware and operating system.
  - Students will install the appropriate version of Linux.
  - Students will demonstrate their Linux installation works by performing a simple test.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log and
    by revisiting the use of Linux in future tasks.


## Learning Plan

(This is what you do before, during, and after a lecture.)

### Before Lecture 

  1. Students should read the class Syllabus.
  2. Students should come to class with a suitable laptop computer or make sure
     to follow the recorded lesson to repeat the process at home.
  3. Students should ensure they have access to the websites listed above
     under resources.

### During Lecture

  1. Course information and introductions.
  2. Navigate to instructions for installing WSL.  If you do not have Windows 10,
     tell me!
  3. Work through the instructions linked to above.  
     Debug situations as is necessary.  Remember to *enable* WSL first,
     which requires the restart.  You will need to define 
     a username and password for WSL.  I recommend your Windows name and password; 
     if you forget it later, you'll have to reinstall!
  4. Open the Ubuntu terminal.  Update as needed or recommended.
  5. Restart, etc., as needed.
  6. Demonstrate a few applications that preview the `bash` introduction.
  7. Install the [X Server for WSL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)
  8. Install `xclock` via `apt-get install x11-apps` and execute.
  9. Debrief with students about remaining issues.

  *WSL is under active development, so don't be discouraged if you have issues!*

### After Lecture

  If you miss lecture or need to review the material, you'll find the link
  to the lecture here.  When relevant, older videos will be linked.

  Also, don't forget to fill out your learning log!  

### Jeremy's Notes

  I'll try to jot down my thoughts about the lesson, similar to your own logs (though less formal and 
  less personal).)

  - Account for Windows update times
  - Bring "red" / "green" indicators
  - Steps 7, 8, and 9 will be done next time (or a quick video will be made).
  - Anything Mac users could do while waiting?...
  - GUIs sound like a hit
