# Interactive Visualization

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

For small data sets and/or static applications, Matplotlib and similar
tools work well.  For larger data sets, more powerful tools are needed.
For real-time inspection of 3-d data, one absolutely needs a
visualization tool.  In this lesson, we look at Visit, which is a
highly-scalable viz tool born out of the ASCI program (which was
the computational solution to the end of underground weapons testing).

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

 - Students will be able to choose the proper tool.
 - Students will be able to find, load, manipulate, and save
   data to file.


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

 - How can I interact with data?

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

The [VTK Book](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/VTKBook) is a good
overview of visualization.


<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will load and view data in Visit.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - [Install Visit](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables) for your platform of choice.
  - Review the Visit [Python API](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/cli_manual/index.html)
  - Download the Visit [sample data](https://wci.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/visit_data_files.tar.gz)

### Live Activities

  1. Verify Visit installations
  2. Verify demo data
  3. Visualize data in VTK file using operators.
  4. Automate viz using Python API.
