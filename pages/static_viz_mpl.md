# Static Viz with Matplotlib

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

In this lesson, we illustrate a few different ways that Matplotlib can 
be used to show data statically.  Although good practice is applied, the 
intent here is to focus on the various tools provided by Matplotlib.


<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

 - Students will be able to choose the proper tool.
 - Students will be able to show data graphically in static 
   and dynamic form.


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

 - How can we plot multiple data types?

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

Probably the best resource to use is the 
[Matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html).




<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will create 1-D and 2-D plots using Matplotlib.
  - Students will read and write numerical and other data from file 
    and select those data to be plotted.
  - Students will report their learning in their logs.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

 - Go over the [Lecture 3](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Basic_Data_Processing_with_NumPy_and_Matplotlib.html) and [Lecture 4](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/More_on_NumPy_Arrays.html) notes from ME 400 on Matplotlib (and NumPy)
 - Skim the examples at the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html)


### Live Activities

  1. Get the data to work with.
  2. Go over trajectory example.  Show that sometimes data modeling
     is needed for effective visualization.
  3. Go over pandemic example.  Show that things like statistical
     spread are easy to highlight using effective color and transparency
     channels.
