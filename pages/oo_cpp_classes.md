# *Object Oriented C++*: Classes and Objects                

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

In this lesson, we learn how to define *classes* that include
a public *interface* and private *attributes*.  The public interface  
include methods for *construction* and *destruction* of an
object and any methods needed to access or modify data an object
encapsulates.  Usually, this data is encapsulated, i.e., it is
not available to the user of the object.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

Allen Downey, *Think C++* is available for
free [online](http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf) and is a nice,
basic introduction to programming using C++ as the language.





<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will articulate the difference between "value", "reference",
    and "pointer."
  - Students will articulate the difference between "pointer" and "array."
  - Students will articulate the difference between "stack" and "heap."
  - Students will write a program that employs array processing.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - Google "C++ Pointers" for one of several short tutorials;
    here's [one](https://gist.github.com/ericandrewlewis/720c374c29bbafadedc9)
    that looks pretty good.  
  - Install Valgrind: `sudo apt install valgrind`
  - Know the difference
    between [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-vs-heap-memory-allocation/)
    and [heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-vs-heap-memory-allocation/) memory allocation.
  - Get this [repository](https://github.com/me701/cpp_pointers_and_arrays)

### Live Activities

  1. Play with pointers.
  2. Execute array examples.

### Videos

- [C++ Pointers and Arrays](tbd)
  and [slides](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2019/lectures/PointersArraysAndMemoryManagement.ipynb).
  Video from 2019 had no audio again, so I'll record the examples again.
