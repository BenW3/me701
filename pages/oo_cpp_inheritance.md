# *Object Oriented C++*: Inheritance and Polymorphism              

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

In this lesson, we learn how to define class inheritance hierarchies.   
By carefully designing classes, inheritance lets us define a wide range
of classes with less code (less code usually leads to fewer bugs).
With polymorphism, we can define rather generalized methods or functions
that can be used with objects from *any* class in a hierarchy provided
we use pointers.  Common features of classes used in hierarchies include
a base *abstract* class, virtual methods (sometimes *pure*),
and *protected* data.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

Allen Downey, *Think C++* is available for
free [online](http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/thinkCScpp.pdf) and is a nice,
basic introduction to programming using C++ as the language.

Bjarne Stroustrup, *A Tour of C++*, 2nd Ed., is a survey of C++ written by
the inventor of C++.  It's a nice and short book that discusses the
essential syntax of modern C++.



<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  -
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
-->

### Required Preparation

- Read Chapters 8, 9 and 14 of [Think C++]().
  Note, 8 and 9 deal with C++ `struct`, which is equivalent to a class
  with one small difference (members are by default `public`, not `private`).
- Review how classes and objects work in Python.
- Clone [this repository](https://github.com/me701/cpp_classes).

### Live Activities

  1. Play with pointers.
  2. Execute array examples.
