## Summary

In this lesson, a brief history of Linux and the open-source world is given.
Moreover, students will be guided through the use of software managers within
a Linux environment to install open-source software.

## Resources

- [Linux and the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) was
written by Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation.
The article provides a nice overview of some of the history (and drama!)
related to Linux, GNU, and the open-source movement.

- The [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)
and the [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) are examples
of open-source licenses often used by developers.  Although they are both
"open," the former is significantly more restrictive by requiring all source
code of developed software to remain open.  In other words, if you wrote a
new program XYZ that incorporates GPL-licensed code, then the source
code for XYZ must, per the license, also be made available.  The MIT license
is much more permissive.  Basically, if you use, adapt, or otherwise include
code licensed this way, all you have to do is include the copyright statement
and license for that software, not the source code for it or any of your
code.

- It was [reported](https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-survey-finds-were-living-in-an-open-source-world/) that
Red Hat, a commercial Linux vendor, found the
world is driven by open-source software.  Historically, open-source solutions
were cheaper, but with the easy, community-driven development of packages,
these solutions also have become the most enabling and advanced.

- Intimately connected to the open-source world is the so-called "hacker culture."
Hacker here does not mean nefarious computational criminal; rather, a hacker
is someone who crafts code in a community of like-minded folks.  A great
series of anecdotes is collected
in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/).
Among the many gems in this book is the proposal of "Linus's Law," which
says that software bugs are easier to fix if more people are looking.
That might seem obvious, but it's not a possible reality if the code can't
be seen outside of a single company!


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will explore and install open-source software from the
    built-in repositories that are required for the class.
  - Students will identify and install software that is relevant to
    their interests, other classes, research, etc. and report on it.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture 

  - Have a machine with Linux installed
  - Read [Linux and the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html)
  - Skim [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)
  - Skim [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  - Skim [Qt and its Open-Source License Option](https://www.qt.io/licensing/open-source-lgpl-obligations)

### During Lecture

  1. Address any issues with Linux installation.
  2. Discuss origin of Linux (the kernel) and GNU (the operating system).
  3. Install one or more open-source packages using the software manager or
     the `apt` utility.
  4. Install VS Code.  Students who have VS Code from ME 400 may have issues
     unless a new version is installed.
