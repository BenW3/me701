# Modules and Unit Tests                                                             

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

Organizing Python code in files leads to importable *modules* that help
us to glue together more complex programs.  With test-driven development
and unit tests, these modules can be produced with fewer bugs and
improved functionality.


<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

A good overview of how test-driven development has impacted scientific computing
is given by

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will clone a sample repository with a predefined module.
  - Students will write unit tests.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

  - Read [Modules and Packages](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Modules_and_Packages.html).
  - Read [Unit Tests and Defensive Programming](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Unit_Tests_and_Defensive_Programming.html).
  - Skim [Test-Driven Development in HPC Science: A Case Study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8452053).
  - Execute `conda install pytest` in the terminal.


### Live Activities

  1. Describe what test-driven development is.
  2. Clone example repository.
  3. Examine the module.
  4. Develop unit tests for a simple function.
