## Summary

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to create a new repository
locally or via GitHub, make changes, commit changes, and push those changes
to a remote destination (e.g., GitHub). Moreover, you should have made
your first commit for Homework 1.

## Resources

The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book is freely available and
provides just about all one needs to dive into `git` for the first time.

Atlassian provides this [nice git cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will define and use variables in `bash`
  - Students will explain what special variables like `$1` mean in `bash`
  - Students will write short functions in `bash` that perform simple
    tasks
  - Students will execute all examples provided in the lesson notebook
