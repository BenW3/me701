## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book is freely available and
provides just about all one needs to dive into `git` for the first time.

Atlassian provides this [nice git cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)

<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will define and use variables in `bash`
  - Students will explain what special variables like `$1` mean in `bash`
  - Students will write short functions in `bash` that perform simple
    tasks
  - Students will execute all examples provided in the lesson notebook
